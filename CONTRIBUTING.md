## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```
   Click the "Fork" button on GitHub
   ```

2. **Create a Test Environment**

   - Follow the [installation guide](INSTALLATION.md)
   - Copy your modified code to test changes

3. **Test Your Changes**
   - Always test in a separate Google Sheet
   - Use the simulation and test features
   - Verify edge cases work correctly

### Making Changes

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Keep changes focused and atomic
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic

3. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Test the specific feature you changed
   - Run end-to-end tests with different scenarios
   - Check error handling

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Add installation notes for new features
   - Update function comments in code

## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/Google Apps Script
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch
- Use console.log for debugging (not alert)

### Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Parses time strings and Date objects into 24-hour format
 * @param {string|Date} timeStr - Time in various formats
 * @return {number} Hour in 24-hour format (0-23) or -1 if invalid
 */
function parseTimeString(timeStr) {
  if (!timeStr) return -1;
  
  // Handle Date objects
  if (timeStr instanceof Date) {
    return timeStr.getHours();
  }
  
  // Handle string formats...
}
```

### HTML/CSS
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Keep CSS organized and commented
- Ensure accessibility (labels, proper form elements)
- Test in different screen sizes
